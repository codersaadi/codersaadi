I'm a **Strategic Full-Stack Developer & Technical Partner** passionate about transforming innovative visions into scalable, production-grade realities. With **4+ years of experience** in full-stack architecture, I specialize in helping startups and growing businesses accelerate their development, build resilient platforms (B2B, C2C, SaaS), and make impactful technology decisions.

My core philosophy revolves around **delivering tangible business value through elegant and efficient technical solutions**. I believe in a collaborative, transparent approach, acting not just as a developer, but as a dedicated partner invested in your success.

## üöÄ What I Bring to the Table

*   **Accelerated Development:** I leverage a powerful, open-source **Accelerator Toolkit** (TypeScript, Next.js, Go-ready backend hooks) that I've meticulously built and refined. This production-grade starter kit includes:
    *   Robust Authentication (Multi-Provider: OIDC, Clerk, NextAuth)
    *   Database Setup (PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)
    *   Payment Integration Readiness
    *   Email System (SES, Resend, SMTP)
    *   Analytics & File Storage (S3/R2)
    *   Typesafe APIs (tRPC), Monorepo Support (Turborepo/NX) & much more!
    *   ‚û°Ô∏è **This can save you 3-6+ months & much upfront engineering costs.**
*   **Expert Platform Architecture:** Deep understanding of designing scalable and resilient systems for various business models (B2B, C2C, B2C, SaaS). Proficient in microservices (Go), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and modern database solutions.
*   **Strategic Technology & Cost Optimization:** I help you navigate the tech landscape, choosing tools (TypeScript, Go, Next.js, Fastify, tRPC) that balance innovation with cost-effectiveness and long-term maintainability.
*   **Holistic Solutions:** From intuitive UI/UX (React, Svelte, Tailwind CSS) to high-performance backends (Node.js, Go) and efficient DevOps (Docker, AWS, Cloudflare), I provide end-to-end expertise.
*   **Continuous Innovation:** I'm constantly researching emerging technologies (e.g., ScyllaDB, WASM, AI in DevTooling) and architectural best practices to ensure your solutions are future-ready.
